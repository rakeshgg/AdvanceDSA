# balanced Tree
  -> left subtree height and right subtree height 
     absolute diff is either 0 or 1 !.e <= 1

# binary tree 
   child 0 or 1 or 2 !.e <=2

# Full of Perfect binary Tree
   last level all leaf node exist
   that is child is 2

# Complete binary Tree:
   - Node are filled from left to right than its complete binary tree

# balanced tree
  - absoulte diff 1 or 0

Edge = node - 1
