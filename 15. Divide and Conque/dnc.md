# Merge Sort

- Using Recursion
- divide and conqure (futt dalo aur raj karo)
- divide and sort during merge

- Find Mid
- break into two halves
- recursion sort two halves
- recursion merge sorted two parts
- array have single elements than sorted
- check inplace merge sort also

# Inversion count

# Quick Sort

A. Partion Logic
s = 0, e = n-1

- pivot elemnt se kitna xota haii count
- swap(arr[pivot], arr[s+count])
  B. Recursive Logic

# backTracking:

- specific form of recursion
- explore all possible path
- rat in a maize example
- 3 digit Locks - explore all possible key
  we have no optimal solution some times so that time we use backtracking
  no chance to optimization - all cases need to handle
